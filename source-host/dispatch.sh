#!/bin/bash
# dispatch.sh - forced SSH command for a nspawn-pull *source* host (not the
# vault). Installed at /usr/local/lib/nspawn-pull/dispatch.sh and wired up
# via a line in this host's /root/.ssh/authorized_keys:
#
#   restrict,command="/usr/local/lib/nspawn-pull/dispatch.sh" <vault-pubkey>
#
# `restrict` + `command=` means sshd only ever runs *this script* for that
# key, regardless of what the client actually asked for - the requested
# command lands in $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND and is otherwise never executed.
# This script is the entire access-control boundary between "a vault has
# this host's key" and "a vault can read/run arbitrary things here" - see
# ../pull-backup-threat-model.md section 3 for the design this implements,
# and treat any change here as security-sensitive.
#
# Whitelists exactly three things, matching engine/pull.sh on the vault
# side: `snapshot-db <name>`, `restore-after-backup <name>`, and a
# read-only rsync of exactly one container's live tree.
